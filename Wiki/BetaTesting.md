# IMPORTANT Notes

1. This is ALPHA release. Some things will not work and this release is intended to test games with Virtual X360 controller only.

2. There is no need to place x360ce.exe inside the game folder. You can keep single copy of executable at one place (for example: C:\Program Files\x360ce\x360ce.exe), because same virtual "Xbox 360 Controller" will be visible for all games in Windows.

3. Do not close "Xbox 360 Controller Emulator" during the game, just minimize it in order to reduce CPU use.

4. Make sure your game is set to use XInput Devices. For example, in "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands" you have to set 
OPTIONS -> CONTROLLER -> ENABLE CONTROLLER: *ONLY GAMEPADS*
